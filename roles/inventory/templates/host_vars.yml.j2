      + "This inventory file contains Ansible's user, Python interpreter and privilege escalation (become) variables as well as interface and service definitions for the host. It should be written in yaml format and named after the FQDN of the host.

Ex: host.site.example.com.yml

Ansible variables that affect how Ansible interacts with the host are defined first. Each of these will be set to a version of the variable that is prefixed with 'update_', the current value of the varible or an arbitrary default based on the most common values.

This file is generated and updated by various roles in the o0-o.site collection. It is acceptable to make manual changes to the values of variables defined here; however, any additional variables will not persist."
