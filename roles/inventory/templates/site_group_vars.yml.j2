This file defines site variables including network definitions. It should be written in yaml and named after the fully qualified domain name of the site, replacing periods with underscores.

Example: site_example_com.yml

Other variables may be added here as well. While parts of this file are generated by Ansible, it will not overwrite the whole file after it has been created. However, it will add to it as sites are created.
